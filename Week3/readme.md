# Week 3 Assignment: Feature Engineering, Dimensionality Reduction, and Model Interpretation

In this week’s assignment, the focus shifts toward **deeper feature analysis**, **dimensionality reduction**, and the implementation of **more advanced predictive models**.

---

## Feature Engineering & Correlation Analysis

You will begin by generating **10–20 meaningful and relevant features** from the dataset. Once created, **correlation analysis** will be performed to identify patterns, multicollinearity, and redundancies across features. This step ensures a better understanding of relationships and supports downstream feature reduction.

---

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

To manage high-dimensional data and improve model performance, **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** will be applied. PCA helps reduce dimensionality while preserving as much variance as possible.  
Visualizations of the principal components will aid in interpreting the structure and distribution of the transformed feature space.

---

## Decision Tree Modeling

A **decision tree model** will serve as the baseline predictive method. Its intuitive tree-like structure provides an interpretable way to understand how the model partitions the data based on feature thresholds.

---

## Boosting Algorithms: XGBoost / AdaBoost

To go beyond the baseline, you will implement powerful **boosting algorithms** such as **XGBoost** or **AdaBoost**. These ensemble techniques iteratively improve upon weak learners and are known for achieving strong predictive accuracy, especially on structured data.

---

## Feature Selection using RFE

**Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** will be used to automatically select the most influential features for the model. This helps reduce overfitting, improve training speed, and enhance generalizability without sacrificing performance.

---

## Model Interpretation with SHAP

Finally, interpretability will be brought into focus using **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**. SHAP values quantify the impact of each feature on the model’s output, offering a detailed view into individual predictions and overall model behavior.
